## Introduction to Pandas

_Data Science and Machine Learning feeds on Data. But we don't (and we can't) dump the raw data to the ML Models. We need to clean and prune it (remember 80/20 rule)_

- _Generate data in the form required by ML models_
- _interrogation of data to extract valuable information_
